Are objectives AKA: bugs/features part of the scope of this app?
OR, should we keep to the Epic level and integrate with tools like Jira
  to aggregate that data for the answers we're looking for?

Integration is inevitable but let's postpone it as long as possible.



Encapsulate this idea in types / functions.


A Team is a [Developer] EG: None, One, or Many Developers.
A Period is an arbitrary amount of time.
    - Usually ~2 weeks AKA a Sprint.
    - Can also be between "Releases" but if CI/CD means you release
        early and often than sprints are more concrete maybe?

As a Team working on a Project,
velocity is 0 & estimate is Infinity for at least a period of time.

After the period, a Team will have finished some work and the complexity
of that work can be aggregated against the time to create a velocity
which can be used to project capacity for future work.

For new projects, as long as the Team has history on other projects
a velocity can be assumed for estimating new work.
