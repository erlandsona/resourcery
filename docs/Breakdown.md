# Questions / Goals?

## For Everyone:
    - Illuminate the cost of context switching.
    - Who's available to work on what when? Forecasting.
    - Bugs should never enter a software system. But how?
        - We didn't have time to test...
            - How can I build in time to test?

        - Our deployment takes too long...
            - How can we build faster & simpler deployment systems?

## For clients:
    - Where is my $ going?
    - How long until what I'm asking for will become a reality?
    - What are my options w/ resp. to solutions?

## For developers: This may be answered if we go with integrations...
    - What do I need to work on today based on what priorities?
